fujinet-tnfs-fuse
=================

An attempt to move TNFS FUSE driver into Python3 realm and currently supported FUSE bindings for Python.

This is all thanks to the renewed TNFS interest from https://fujunet.online Atari 8-bit community.

- [x] Client is running with Python3 now.
- [ ] FUSE driver not working yet

The original message from Author below:

spectranet-tnfs-fuse
====================

Linux FUSE filesystem driver for use with the TNFS filesystem that the ZX Spectranet uses.
I made this only because I wanted easy access to vexed4.alioth.net from my computer, and
the corresponding directories in SVN were empty.

Quality is to be considered Alpha. If it eats your data, I take no responsibility.

I'm creating this repository here because I can't for the life of me figure out how to contact
Winston, the creator of the Spectranet Ethernet interface for the ZX Spectrum, to include this
into his repository.
